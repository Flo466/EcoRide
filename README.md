# EcoRide - Carpooling Application

## Project Description

**EcoRide** is a carpooling application developed as part of a school project. It aims to facilitate connections between drivers and passengers for shared journeys, promoting more ecological and economical mobility.

## Key Features

- Search for trips by departure location, destination, and date.
- Offer trips (for drivers).
- User profile management (login/registration).
- Review and rating system.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Symfony 6.4 (PHP 8.3)
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), Bootstrap 5.3
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)**  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

- **Visual Studio Code**  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- **VS Code "PHP Server" Extension**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Install it directly from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.

- **Node.js and npm**  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation and Launching the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository and Switch to `developement` Branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flo466/EcoRide.git
cd ecoride
git checkout developement
```
---

### 2. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

In VS Code, at the root of the backend directory, create a file named `.env` with the following content:

```env
APP_ENV=dev
APP_SECRET=your_symfony_secret_here (generate a key)

DATABASE_URL="mysql://${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_PASSWORD}@ecoride_db:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE}?serverVersion=8.0.32&charset=utf8mb4"

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_password_ecoride (use your own password)
MYSQL_DATABASE=ecoride
MYSQL_USER=ecoride_user (use your own user name)
MYSQL_PASSWORD=ecoride_password (use your own password)

CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN='^https?://(localhost|127\.0\.0\.1)(:[0-9]+)?$'
```

You can generate a secure random string for APP_SECRET using the following command:

```bash
php -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(32));"

```


### 3. Verify init_db.sh Line Endings (Windows Users):

If you are on Windows, ensure the backend/init_db.sh file is saved with LF (Line Feed) line endings.

Open the init_db.sh file at the root of the backend directory in VS Code.

Look at the bottom right of the VS Code status bar it might show "CRLF" (but if it already shows "LF", it's all good).

Click on "CRLF" and select "LF" from the pop-up menu and save the file.

This step is crucial to prevent "no such file or directory" errors in the Linux-based Docker container.

### 4. Launch Docker services

Then launch the services (make sure you're still at the root of the backend directory in your terminal):

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

To verify backend readiness:

```bash
docker-compose logs symfony_backend
```

Look for:  
**`Development server listening on http://0.0.0.0:8000`**

---

### 5. Frontend Launch

Navigate at he root of the project (ecoride directory):

```bash
cd ..
```

The frontend is located in the root directory of the project EcoRide.
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Launch PHP Server from VS Code:

- At the root of the project
- Click left on `index.html`, then click the **"PHP Server"** icon in the top-right bar:

### 6. Access the Application

- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`

The frontend will automatically communicate with the backend.
