- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), Bootstrap 5
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine)**  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Download Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

- **Visual Studio Code**  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

- **VS Code "PHP Server" Extension**  
  ðŸ‘‰ Install it directly from the VS Code Extensions Marketplace.

- **Node.js and npm**  
  ðŸ‘‰ [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Installation and Launching the Application

### 1. Clone the Repository and Switch to `developement` Branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flo466/EcoRide.git
cd EcoRide
git checkout development
```
---

### 2. Backend Setup and Launch

Navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
```

Create a file named `.env` with the following content:

```env
APP_ENV=dev
APP_SECRET=your_symfony_secret_here (generate a key)

DATABASE_URL="mysql://${MYSQL_USER}:${MYSQL_PASSWORD}@ecoride_db:3306/${MYSQL_DATABASE}?serverVersion=8.0.32&charset=utf8mb4"

MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_password_ecoride (use you own password)
MYSQL_DATABASE=ecoride
MYSQL_USER=ecoride_user (use you own user name)
MYSQL_PASSWORD=ecoride_password (use you own password)

CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN='^https?://(localhost|127\.0\.0\.1)(:[0-9]+)?$'
```

You can generate a secure random string for APP_SECRET using the following command:

```bash
php -r "echo bin2hex(random_bytes(32));"

```

Then launch the services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

To verify backend readiness:

```bash
docker-compose logs symfony_backend
```

Look for:  
**`Development server listening on http://0.0.0.0:8000`**
